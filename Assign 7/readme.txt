The students.data file lists all students (first name then last name), their V numbers, and their passwords (if the student's password exists, if no password exists for this student this field is left blank).  Each field is separated by a semicolon ";".

The passwords.data file lists all days the class has or will meet, and the daily passwords associated with that day.  Each field is separated by a semicolon ";".

The attendance data files follow the naming convention of year-month-day.data (for example, January 3 2012 would be named as "2012-1-3.data").  Each attendance data file lists all students (first name then last name), and the time they signed in (as a Unix timestamp, if empty then that student did not sign in).
